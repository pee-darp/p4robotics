Note from previous homeworks:
1) Use as less headers and functions as necessary while ensuring independence and minimal functionality of each piece.
--> Use a header file for all data structures.
--> Use a graphics.c file for all graphics related functions
--> Use a physics.c file for all physics functions.

Maybe make a folder for each of these utilities.

2) Physics related utilities:
  a) Collision detection.

3) Graphics related utilities:
  a)set_color_pixel(x,y,bmp,color) - given pixel coordinates, bmp file and a colour, draw the pixel.
  b)plotLine(x1,y1,x2,y2,bmp,color) - given line coordinates, bmp file and a colour, draw the line.
  c)calcRect(width, height, bmp, color) - given width and height of a rectangle, calculate path of the rectangle.
  d)roundPoly(polygon_t) - given a list of coordinates, round them.
  e)plotPoly(pixel_t list, bool fill) - given a list of vertices to plot, plot the polygon based on whether it needs to be filled or not.
  f)calcTriangle(size) - given size of triangle, calculate a triangle of some fixed ratio.
  g)rotPoly
  h)transPoly
  i)bmp utilities

4) Data structures:
  a)bitmap_t
  b)polygon_t
  c)
